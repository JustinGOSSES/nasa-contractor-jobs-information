Place to put information about where to look for NASA contractor jobs so I can just send people a link to it and not have to retype

<i>WARNING: This is just my opinion at one point in time and likely will be incorrect and out of date in some form almost immediately.</i>

## Problem this document attempts to impact
There is no single site to go to for NASA contractor specific job searches. If you are looking for NASA civil servant jobs, there is https://www.usajobs.gov/ . 

There is things that sorta approach it, like https://www.spacetalent.org/ , a job search site "for the space economy" but space talent only has a small percent of NASA contractors advertising jobs there and some of the companies are very adjacent to space to put it mildly.

Job search companies like https://www.indeed.com/ & https://www.linkedin.com/ have gotten better at returning useful results when you type in "NASA" but they fundemntally rely on companies explicitly mentioning "NASA" in their job description and advertising on one of those sites. 

Companies nearly never mention "NASA" in the job title and it is uncommon to see it mentioned in the body even if the job is 100% NASA contractor.

<b><i>The bulk of this README is devoted to listing the various places to find lists of NASA contractors.</i></b>

## Civil Servant vs. Contractor
### The majority of NASA is contractors.
Although most people think about working for NASA in terms of a civil servant job in which one works directly for NASA, most of NASA's work is actually done by contractors who make a much larger workforce. 

However, if you are looking for NASA civil servant jobs, check here: https://www.usajobs.gov/ 

### Internships
For interns wanted to intern at NASA, please note that there are basically 3 types of interns:
- interns for the various contractor companies
- interns for USRA, which is a comapny that manages most of the NASA interns on behalf of NASA. This is the way most students intern.
- Pathways internships. These are basically interning for NASA, aka the federal government directly. Students that get hired out of school for NASA do several pathways internships before becoming actual normal civil servants.

WARNING: None of the information above may be accurate at some point in future time and it certainly isn't comprehense.  

#### Accrediation Trap for Pathways Interns
Also, please note that there are many pathways internship positions where your school must have an accrediated engineering program and there is only one accrediation agency allowed. This has applied for things like computer science internships where your major isn't an engineering major. In my opinion it is dumb, but there have been students I know who did know things until it was too late and would have otherwise gone to a completely differente school.

### Variation in Contractor Experience
Some contractors work onsite at NASA centers and are very integrated into the main NASA in terms of day to day meetings, culture, etc. Others are mostly or entirely offsite, produce product X that meets requirements a, b, and c. These contractors work more for their contractor company in terms of culture, reporting, meetings, location, etc. 

## Who Are NASA Contractors? 
This is less clear an issues

## Official Listings
Every NASA center typically has a listing of the prime contractors somewhere on their public website. Where that list sites and the format of it is highly variable. 

Additionally, these are often just lists of prime contractors. Most of the prime contractor has sub-contractors that are on the same contract. The sub-contractors may not be listed on the NASA generated lists.

### NASA-wide Contractor Lists
- WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NASA_contractors 
- aeroweb: "NASA's Top 100 Contractors": http://fi-aeroweb.com/Top-100-NASA-Contractors.html
- NASA contractors from usaspending.gov which requires a lot of button clicks to get to just NASA but possible: https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/agency
- SAM.GOV : technically should have finer details than usaspending.gov but the site has horrible user interface so it in no way obvious what anything on the site does unless you sit through long videos classes on each button/report type. It is insanely stupid: https://sam.gov/
