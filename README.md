# nasa-contractor-jobs-information
This is a place I'm  putting information about where to look for NASA contractor jobs, so I can just send people a link to it and not have to retype it all out each email.

<i>WARNING: This is just my opinion at one point in time and likely will be incorrect and out of date in some form almost immediately.</i>

If you have any improvements or edits, please read the <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/nasa-contractor-jobs-information/blob/main/contributing.md">contributing guidelines</a>.

#### My Experience

From 2016 to 2021, I worked as as <a href="https://justingosses.com/resume/"> S.A.I.C. contractor for NASA</a> supporting the Office of Chief Information Officer Transformation and Data Division on open data, open code, code platform, data analytics, and machine learning tasks. 

Working as a NASA contractor can be a great experience. I certainly found my time there to a great opportunity. Nearly everyone works with a base assumption that things can be done better. You get to directly or indirectly work on things that matter and inspire.

NASA needs and deserves top contractor staff, but sometimes it can be hard for people to find the door. The path in for civil servants is fairly well known with lots of written about it, the contractor path less so. After seeing a small slice of this information in a twitter thread that got a lot of engagement, I thought there might be reason to write up this document. 

## Problem this document attempts to impact
Although most people think about working for NASA in terms of a civil servant job in which one works directly for NASA, <i>most of NASA's work is actually done by contractors who make a much larger workforce</i>. 

<b><i>There is no single site to go to for NASA contractor specific job searches.</i></b>

If you are looking for NASA civil servant jobs, there is https://www.usajobs.gov/ . 

There are things that sorta approach being a contractor version of https://www.usajobs.gov/, like https://www.spacetalent.org/ , a job search site "for the space economy" but space talent has only a small percent of all NASA contractor companies advertising jobs there. Additionally, some of the companies advertising there are only very adjacent to the space industry to put it mildly.

Job search companies like https://www.indeed.com/ & https://www.linkedin.com/ have gotten better at returning useful results when you type in "NASA" but they fundementally rely on companies explicitly mentioning "NASA" in their job description and advertising on one of those sites. 

Many companies nearly never mention "NASA" in the job title and often don't mention "NASA" in the body either, even if the job is 100% NASA contractor.

<b><i>The bulk of this README is devoted to listing the various places to find lists of NASA contractors.</i></b>

### Internships
For interns wanted to intern at NASA, please note that there are basically 3 types of interns:
- interns for the various contractor companies
- interns for USRA, which is a comapny that manages most of the NASA interns on behalf of NASA. This is the way most students intern.
- Pathways internships. These are basically interning for NASA, aka the federal government directly. Students that get hired out of school for NASA do several pathways internships before becoming normal civil servants. It seems common to do a USRA internship first and then get a Pathways intern later.

WARNING: None of the information above may be accurate at some point in future time and it certainly isn't comprehense.  

#### Accrediation Trap for Pathways Interns
Also, please note that there are many pathways internship positions where your school must have an accrediated engineering program and there is only one accrediation agency allowed. This rule has in the past been applied for positions like a Pathways computer science internship where the required major (computer science) wouldn't normally be considered an engineering major. I known of several students who didn't realize their school made them ineligible for pathways interns until it was too late to change schools. I know one who changed schools because of it.

### Variation in Contractor Experience 
#### (onsite, offsite, and how plugged in you are to centralized NASA)
Some contractors work onsite at NASA centers and are very integrated into the main NASA in terms of day to day meetings, culture, etc. 

Others are mostly or entirely offsite, produce product X that meets requirements a, b, and c. These contractors work more for their contractor company in terms of culture, reporting, meetings, location, etc. 

### Can Foreign Nationals be NASA Contractors?
I'll have to give a hand wavy answer here based on my both my limited knowledge, the limted public documentation on this question, and the extent to which the answer really just depends on position specific things you might have no way of knowing from the outside.

In general.....Most of the time no. In special circumstances yes. 

Usually, the position description will include this information, but not hundred percent of the time.

JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) has foreign nationals working for it. However, not all jobs there can be worked by foreign nationals. That being said, if you're wanting to have a good chance of a NASA tied job being accepting of foriegn nationals, JPL is probably your best bet in terms of both scale and percentages. 

Similarly, other physical science facilities run by another organization on behalf of NASA are generally more likely on average to accept foreign national applicants. JPL is by far the biggest of those.

Where it gets very unlikely that a position will accept foreign national applicants is positions that are either onsite at a physical locality where there are rockets, testing, engineering, or space communications or where you might have easier "IT" access to those things. 

Again, this is very hand wavy and just observations. These aren't rules or guidelines. Don't depend on any of these vague generalizations being correct.

### Remote NASA Contractor Jobs
Some NASA contractor jobs will now explicitly say in the job advertisement that they are remote friendly. However, some of them that are possible to work remotely won't state it is possible to work them remotely. You may have to ask. The HR contact listed probably won't know, but asking the HR contact to direct the question to the hiring manager, if they don't know themselves, can be a good tactic. Otherwise, they'll likely just repeat what's already written in the advertisement. I've started to see language like "this job is onsite at " to convey that a job is not remote friendly, but it seems the standard language is still developing.

## Who Are NASA Contractor Companies? 
This is less clear than you might expect.

### Official Listings
Every NASA center has a listing of the prime contractors somewhere on their public website. Where that list is located online and the format of it is highly variable. 

Additionally, these lists often just list prime contractors. Most of the prime contractor have sub-contractors. The sub-contractors may not be listed on the lists of contractors that NASA puts out.

### NASA-wide Contractor Lists
- WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NASA_contractors 
- aeroweb: "NASA's Top 100 Contractors": http://fi-aeroweb.com/Top-100-NASA-Contractors.html
- NASA contractors from usaspending.gov which requires a lot of button clicks to get to just NASA but possible: https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/agency
- SAM.GOV : technically should have finer details than usaspending.gov but the site has horrible user interface so it in no way obvious what anything on the site does unless you sit through long videos classes on each button/report type. https://sam.gov/

## So....how do I use this information?
I'll start right out and say there isn't a great answer to this. A few strategies are listed below.

### Rely on Job Search Sites
None of the job search sites that I know allow you to upload a list of company titles and say just give me the current jobs being advertised by those companies. This is unfortunate, as it would pretty much solve the problem, or at least 85% of the way to a solution. 

The alternative is to use the advanced search functionality to at least focus on job descriptions with "NASA" or "johnson space center" mentioned somewhere in them. This does an alright job, but it certainly misses a lot as well. 

Here is a link to indeed results for any job description with "nasa": https://www.indeed.com/advanced_search?q=nasa&l= 

Here is a link to ineed results for any job description with "johnson space center": https://www.indeed.com/advanced_search?q=johnson%20space%20center&l=

The signal to noise ratio is better in the second option, but you might get more results in total with the first.

<B><i>IF YOU WANT A QUICK SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF MANUAL WORK OR TECH SKILS, THIS IS IT.</i></b>

However, it will miss a certain % of the open and publicly advertised jobs.

### Focus Your Search To A Few Companies & Check Their Websites Directly
You could limit your search to contractor companies that are listed as the prime contractor at the center nearest to you. You could also limit it to companies listed on the NASA center's prime contractor list as doing work related to the type of job you're interested in. Some but not all of the center lists also detail what types of work each contractor company is responsible for hiring. A little sleuthing might even get you what NASA orgs each some of the contractors support.

At the end, you might narrow things down to 5-15 companies whose job sites you can check manually every week or so.

This takes a lot of time but it would give you good, if potentially too focused, coverage across open NASA contractor jobs.

### Integrations with Job Sites?
You might wonder why someone doesn't just automate this process into their own NASA contractor specific job site? 

The short answer is job sites like indeed and others seem to have been moving away from making their APIs easily accessible and reusable for this purpose. They want job seekers to go to their site directly it seems.</i>

For example, LinkedIN has information on their APIs here: https://developer.linkedin.com/ but it doesn't look like any of these are really geared to job searchers or webpages that are built for job searchers. Google results will return tutorials and examples of developers using Indeed's API, but they are mostly all from 2014-2018 and use an API now depreciated.

If you're really want to build on top of results coming from job search sites, it looks like, at least currently, you're limited to building web scrapers to extract the content from these sites. There's a bunch of people who have done that, of course, but it can be dubious from a copyright and legal standpoint, especially if expressly forbidden by the site. 

### Programmatic Extracting of Job Information from Contractor Websites Directly
Another option that I haven't seen done but theoretically could be done is you build your own clone of indeed/LinkedIN that uses web scraping to get data from each contractor's career page. 

##### CONs

One of the obvious disadvantages of this approach is it takes a lot of work. You'd have to build a scraper and adapt it to each contractor company's career page. You'd then have to normalize the content and display it on your own front-end. You'd probably want to build in some sort of automated re-generation that would run the scraper every day or so and re-populate your webpage. Additionally, any time a contractor company changed their career page, you'd have to re-write that portion of your code. There would also be some company's career pages that have techniques in place to block bots, which is what your scraper would be.

##### PROs

This is the only method that would get you all the jobs from NASA contractors that you're interested in on a regular basis. Theoretically, you could even put ads on the site to attempt to recoup some of your costs from building and maintaining the site. This is one of <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/sideproject_planning">my side project ideas</a> that I've never done. A big question for me is how much time it would continuously take to maintain even if you did build it.
